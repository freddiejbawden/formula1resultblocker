# Formula 1 Result Blocker
## Chrome Extension

A very simple Chrome extension made primarily for my dad. He is always saying that always gets annoyed when websites have the F1 Results
on the front page - thus spoiling the race. This Chrome Extension searches any webpage when it is loaded and blacks out any HTML element with certain keywords in. 

In future I would like to add the functionalilty to allow users to add their own lists, and have keywords stored in text files
